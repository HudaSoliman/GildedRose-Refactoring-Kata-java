# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-java

This is a  refactoring to the Gilded Rose Kata.

The approach was:

TDD approach: Adding unit tests first to understand logic better and making sure that refactoring will not change anything.
Refactorining to make no nested if statements .

Add new 'conjured' requirement (TDD style)

Implementing the code in a Strategy Pattern Design: By adding a QualityManager to the GildedRose to handle all the updating algorithm.
